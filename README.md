# Sentiment Analyzer

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project that processes text data, engineers features, builds a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance. The project is structured into four main steps: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model creation, and evaluation.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the emotional tone behind a body of text. This project aims to build a sentiment analyzer that can classify text as positive or negative. The process involves cleaning and preparing the text data, engineering features, training a logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance.

## Data Preprocessing

The first step in the sentiment analysis pipeline is text cleaning, which involves several sub-steps to ensure the data is ready for analysis:

1. **Correction of Typos**: Automatically corrects spelling errors in the text.
2. **Mapping and Replacement**: Normalizes text by mapping non-standard words to their standardized forms.
3. **Expanding Contractions**: Converts contractions (e.g., "don't" to "do not") to their expanded forms.
4. **Removing Accents and Diacritics**: Strips accents and diacritical marks from characters.
5. **Removing Extra Whitespace**: Eliminates unnecessary spaces from the text.
6. **Eliminating HTML Tags**: Removes HTML tags from text data.
7. **Handling URLs**: Strips URLs from the text to reduce noise.
8. **Handling Abbreviations**: Expands common abbreviations to their full forms.
9. **Case Standardizing and Removing Special Characters**: Converts text to lowercase and removes special characters.
10. **Removing Stopwords**: Eliminates common stopwords that do not contribute to sentiment.

## Feature Engineering

In this step, we use N-grams to capture the context of words in the text. We employ both Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer to transform the text data into numerical features suitable for model training.

## Model Creation

We use a Logistic Regression model to classify the sentiment of the text. Logistic Regression is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

## Model Evaluation

The model is tested and evaluated to determine its accuracy and performance. We analyze its strengths and weaknesses, particularly its performance on short versus long reviews.

## Future Directions

- **Data Augmentation**: Incorporate more short reviews to improve model performance on brief texts.
- **Advanced Models**: Explore more complex models like neural networks for better handling of nuanced sentiment.
- **Feature Enhancement**: Integrate sentiment lexicons and pre-trained embeddings to enrich feature representation.
